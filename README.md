# Live Weather Application

# Description
The main goal of this project was to sharpen my JavaScript skills. This single page application allows users to enter a location and it will fetch the current weather and local time in that place. Upon each search, the background of the page will also change to match the location being searched.

# Data Sources
1. Unplash API - Allows for random image fetch based on keywords
2. OpenWeatherMap API - Returns current weather based on geo-location input
